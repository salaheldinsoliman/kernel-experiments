# A Collection of HPC Kernel Experiments

This repository is a **collection of experiments exploring kernel-level optimizations and scheduling strategies for High-Performance Computing (HPC)** workloads.

These experiments aim to systematically evaluate how different Linux kernel configurations, scheduling policies, and system-level tuning affect performance across a variety of HPC workload types.

Current experiments include:
- **Tickless Kernel Experiment**
- **Scheduler Policy Experiment on CFS**

More experiments will be added as this project evolves.
